# Awesome IOWN tech.

# About IOWN Specifications,
IOWN is a hardware and communication-related technology being researched primarily by NTT, a Japanese telecommunications carrier.
IOWN is an efficient platform construction by processing protocols and encoding processes, such as HTTP, which have been processed by software in existing systems, on an independent chip.

I would like to pioneer the development of software for IOWN.

I look forward to seeing you in the future.
